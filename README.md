### silly think for our field
## use admin.html to add teams to selection

open index.html and press button to add to queue (team cant be added if they are already in queue)

open queue.html to see curent team with time remaning

default field time can be set on admin page

admin can pause timer, move or remove team's position in the queue, add or delete teams from the selection buttons, change default timer value, change teams timers manualy ifspesific team needs more time,
